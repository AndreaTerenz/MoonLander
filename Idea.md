# LANDER

## Abstract
Inspired by the old Lunar Lander arcade game, High Fleet and frankly [Jump King](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1061090/Jump_King/) too.
You control a **ship/lander** and have to move through **a series of interconnected levels** (maybe one of top of the other like Jump King, maybe simply in sequence). 
In each level there are also other **enemy landers** and you are armed & armored to defeat them.
In each level you can find:

- loot (of some kind)
- checkpoints (safe landing pads)
- powerups/refills
- upgrades shops where you can spend your loot to improve weapons & ammo
